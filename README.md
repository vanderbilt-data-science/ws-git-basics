# repo-template-workshop

From a graphical user interface to the command line, understanding git basics will keep you productive, out of trouble, and in the good graces of your teammates. 


## Goal
Provide an overview of the goals and deliverables of the project. Mention any relevent details or issues. 

## Before the Workshop  

Before the workshop, be sure to complete two tasks so that you can code along with me:

1. Create a GitHub.com account at https://github.com/

2. If you are on Windows, download Git for Windows from https://git-scm.com/download/win

You might also want to practice getting to your command line. On a Mac, follow the directions at HowTo Get to the Command Line on a Mac (https://www.wikihow.com/Get-to-the-Command-Line-on-a-Mac). On Windows,  try right-clicking on a folder in Windows Explorer and selecting "Git Bash Here".

## Setting up Git

The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address. Use the e-mail address associated with your GitHub account

$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com

Sometimes you want to use an editor when using command line git (such as when you have a long commit message). To set which editor should be your default, follow the directions at https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/02-setup/index.html


## Resources

Provide links to any resources that may be useful in running the repo (python/git/accre tutorials etc). \

## Videos
